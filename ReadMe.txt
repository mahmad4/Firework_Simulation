I have two classes:
1. The 'main' which makes the canvas and sets it visible
2. 'Fireworks' that creates the projectile.

I made my GUI to be a border layout.
On the north side, I have a box layout with the speed, angle and time slider.
On the east side, I have a box layout with the colors, explosion types and the start button.

I have used JRadioButtons for colors and explosion types.

I set the variables inside the actionPerformed and stateChanged.

I have animated the fireworks; therefore, I have the TimerCallback method which repaints the firework.

Inside my paintComponent:
Time changes to seconds and prints the firework trajectory or the explosion depending on the time.

The firework are animated.
